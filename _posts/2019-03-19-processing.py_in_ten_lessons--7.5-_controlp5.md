## ControlP5

*ControlP5* is a feature-packed GUI library, full of options for building and customising user interfaces. It provides an extensive set of control widgets that include buttons, sliders, knobs, toggles, textfields, checkboxes, accordions, charts, timers, drop-downs, tab- and window-interfaces, and more.

To begin using ControlP5, one must first install it. From the Processing menu bar, select **Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library...**

This raises the Contribution Manager window; under the *Libraries* tab, locate and install ControlP5.

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-install-library.png" />
</figure>

Once you've the library installed, create a new sketch named "identikit". An identikit -- or *facial composite* -- is a portrait image reconstructed from the memory of one or many eyewitnesses. You've probably seen criminal identikits in police stations or on the news. These are rendered in various ways, namely: by sketch artists; or using a system of overlaid transparencies; or with computer software. Our identikit program will be no use for any real-world application, but fun to play with, nonetheless. To get started, add the following code.

{% highlight py %}
add_library('controlP5')

def setup():
    size(720,485)
    global cp5
    cp5 = ControlP5(this)

def draw():
    background('#004477')
    stroke('#FFFFFF')
    strokeWeight(3)
    axis = 250

    # face
    noFill()
    ellipse(axis,220, 370,370)
{% endhighlight %}

Processing requires the `add_library()` line for loading in ControlP5. In the `setup` block, a new ControlP5 instance is assigned to a variable named `cp5`. From here on, one can access ContolP5 features with a `cp5.` prefix; this will make sense a little further along when we begin to add controllers. The `axis` coordinate runs through the centre of the `ellipse`; in other words, it marks the horizontal centre of the circular 'face'. The face is positioned to the left of the display to make room for control widgets on the right.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-start.png" />
  <figcaption>
    The circle will serve as the outline of the face. The empty area to the right is for control widgets.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The first widget will be a textfield. The controller is added to the `setup` function.

{% highlight py %}
def setup():
    ...
    (cp5.addTextfield('alias')
        .setPosition(500,20)
        .setSize(200,25)
    )
{% endhighlight %}

The brackets surrounding the `cp5.addTextfield()` lines may look odd, but this is necessary to break the chain of [methods]({% post_url 2018-06-21-processing.py_in_ten_lessons--2.3-_strings %}#string-methods) over multiple lines. Alternatively, you could write this all on a single line but likely won't find it as readable. Whenever you create a new controller, specify a name in the first argument -- in this case, I have used `'alias'`. This name is used to reference the controller further along and also serves as the default label for the field.

In the `draw` function, retrieve the captured input and render it using a `text()` function. You use the `getController()` method to access the properties of any `cp5` controller (by its name), and chain a `getText()` onto this to isolate the text value.

{% highlight py %}
def draw():
    ...
    # alias
    fill('#FFFFFF')
    textSize(20)
    textAlign(CENTER)
    alias = cp5.getController('alias').getText()
    text(alias, axis,450)
    noFill()
{% endhighlight %}

Test out the input field. The alias you enter will appear beneath the face.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-textfield.png" />
</figure>

Next, we'll add widgets for controlling the eyes. The additional methods, `setRange()` and `setValue()`, set the lower/upper value range and in the initial value, respectively.

{% highlight py %}
def setup():
    ...
    (cp5.addSlider('eye distance')
        .setPosition(500,80)
        .setSize(200,20)
        .setRange(30,120)
        .setValue(80)
    )
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-slider-default-label.png" />
</figure>

The problem is that the default position for any slider label is to the right of the widget, which doesn't fit nicely in this layout. Add some code that adjusts the alignment and padding to reposition the label at the bottom left.

{% highlight py %}
        ...
        .setValue(80)
    )
    (cp5.getController('eye distance')
        .getCaptionLabel()
        .align(ControlP5.LEFT, ControlP5.BOTTOM_OUTSIDE)
        .setPaddingX(0)
    )
{% endhighlight %}

Before drawing the eyes on the face, add three more control widgets -- a knob and two toggles:

{% highlight py %}
def setup():
    ...
    (cp5.addKnob('eye size')
        .setPosition(515,135)
        .setRadius(35)
        .setRange(10,60)
        .setValue(50)
    )

    (cp5.addToggle('heavy brow')
        .setPosition(635,138)
        .setSize(20,20)
    )

    (cp5.addToggle('sleepless')
        .setPosition(635,185)
        .setSize(20,20)
    )
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-eye-widgets.png" />
  <figcaption>To operate the knob, click and hold it, then pull left and right to adjust the value.</figcaption>
</figure>

To draw the eyes, add the following lines to your `draw` function. You'll notice that a `getController()` is used to retrieve each of the controller properties -- but, unlike the textfield -- there are `getValue()` methods in place of `getText()`.

{% highlight py %}
def draw():
    ...
    # eyes
    eyedistance = cp5.getController('eye distance').getValue()
    eyesize = cp5.getController('eye size').getValue()
    ellipse(axis-eyedistance,180, eyesize,eyesize)
    ellipse(axis+eyedistance,180, eyesize,eyesize)

    if cp5.getController('heavy brow').getValue():
        fill('#004477'); stroke('#004477')
        rect(100,180-eyesize/2, 300,eyesize/2)
        stroke('#FFFFFF')
        line(
          axis-eyedistance-eyesize/2-5, 180,
          axis+eyedistance+eyesize/2+5, 180
        )

    if cp5.getController('sleepless').getValue():
        noFill()
        arc(axis-eyedistance,190, eyesize,eyesize, 0,HALF_PI)
        arc(axis+eyedistance,190, eyesize,eyesize, HALF_PI,2.5)
        fill('#004477')
{% endhighlight %}

Run the sketch a have a play with the various eye features.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-eye-adjustments.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

For the nose, we'll add a 2D slider; for the mouth, a standard slider but with tick marks for set increments.

{% highlight py %}
def setup():
    ...
    (cp5.addSlider2D('nose position')
        .setPosition(500,240)
        .setSize(200,100)
        .setMinMax(-30,-20,30,20)
        .setValue(0,0)
    )

    (cp5.addSlider('mouth width')
        .setPosition(500,375)
        .setSize(200,20)
        .setRange(10,200)
        .setValue(124)
        .setNumberOfTickMarks(6)
        .setSliderMode(Slider.FLEXIBLE)
    )
    (cp5.getController('mouth width')
        .getCaptionLabel()
        .align(ControlP5.LEFT, ControlP5.BOTTOM_OUTSIDE)
        .setPaddingX(0)
        .setPaddingY(12)
    )

def draw():
    ...
    # nose
    noseposition = cp5.getController('nose position')
    nosex = noseposition.getArrayValue()[0]
    nosey = noseposition.getArrayValue()[1]
    line(axis-10+nosex,180+nosey, axis-10+nosex,300+nosey)
    line(axis-10+nosex,300+nosey, axis-10+nosex+30,300+nosey)

    # mouth
    mouthwidth = cp5.getController('mouth width').getValue()
    line(axis-mouthwidth/2,340, axis+mouthwidth/2,340)
{% endhighlight %}

The 2D slider holds two values in a list, hence the `.getArrayValue()` white square brackets. If you are confused about what the different methods control, try adjusting the arguments to see what effect this has.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-nose-and-mouth.png" />
</figure>

We'll add one final button widget that will save the image as a TIFF file. Using the `.addButton()` method, place a new button at the lower right of the display window.

{% highlight py %}
(cp5.addButton('save image')
    .setPosition(500,440)
    .setSize(200,25)
)
{% endhighlight %}

One can attach event handlers like any other method. These require a Python *lambda* -- but for now, all you need to know is where to write the lambda. We'll not review lambdas in these lessons, but if you wish to explore them further, wait until after lesson 8 on functions (they'll make far more sense, after that).

{% highlight py %}
(cp5.addButton('save image')
    .setPosition(500,440)
    .setSize(200,25)
    .onClick( lambda e: println(e.getController().getInfo()) )
)
{% endhighlight %}

The `e` variable serves the same role as in the mouse event examples from earlierThat's, it holds all of the properties related to the event (in this case, an `.onClick`). You may also name `e` whatever you wish. To provide some insight into what these properties are, we'll print them to the console.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-lambda.png" class="fullwidth" />
  <figcaption>Clicking the SAVE IMAGE button produces the following Console output.</figcaption>
</figure>

Of course, we wish to save an image, so change the lambda line, replacing everything after the colon with a `save()` function that uses the alias input for a filename.

    .onClick( lambda e: save(cp5.getController('alias').getText()) )

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl07/controlp5-identikit-save.png" class="fullwidth" />
  <figcaption>The SAVE IMAGE button now saves a .tif file using the alias as a filename.</figcaption>
</figure>

that's as far as we'll venture into ControlP5. There's plenty more to explore, though. For instance, while pressing the *Alt* key and click-and-dragging, controllers can be moved about the display. You can also hide all of the controllers using *Alt+Shift+H*. To activate these shortcut features, add a `cp5.enableShortcuts()` line somewhere in the setup block.

{% highlight py %}
def setup():
    ...
    cp5.enableShortcuts()
{% endhighlight %}

For more examples of how to use ControlP5, refer to the **File > Examples...** menu. In the window that pops-up, you'll find an extensive selection of sample sketches. Be warned though: almost all of these are written in Processing's Java language. In spite of this, it should be similar enough for you to understand and translate to Python.

</figure>

That's all for this lesson. Feel welcome to experiment with and add additional features to the tasks you've completed.

## Lesson 8

You'll often find that you repeat the same, or very similar, lines of code within a single sketch. Moreover, as your programs grow more complex, repetition tends to creep in. For more modular and reusable code, one can employ *functions*. In the next chapter, you'll look at how to define and work with functions. As a concept, you should grasp functions without much trouble, especially considering what you managed thus far. On the other hand, I'll still be throwing in some crunchy tasks to keep you challenged!
