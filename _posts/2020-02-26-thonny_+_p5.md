You can combine *Thonny* and *p5* for a Processing-esque, Python 3 development environment that runs off a USB drive. There are situations where you may prefer to use p5 over Processing Python Mode / processing.py. This is also handy for teaching programming in computer labs where students cannot install software, or any situation where you do not have administrative rights to install software.

This post covers how to roll-your-own portable Thonny + p5 IDE for Windows computers. The process is similar for Mac and Linux setups, although I will not cover the procedure for these platforms.

## Thonny

If you haven't heard about [Thonny](https://thonny.org/), it's a Python IDE catering to any beginners looking to dabble in Python. Thonny offers a quick and easy way to get coding in Python. In a downloadable zip file, less than 30 MB in size, you get a neat editor bundled with Python (version 3.7 at the time of writing). The user interface is stripped back, but you can display several extra panels, like a panel to list your variables, an outline panel for your functions, an object inspector, an interactive debugger, a shell, a plotter, and more. It's multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux), open-source, and there's a *portable* version too.

## Portable Applications

A 'portable' application is one that does not include an installer. It's a stand-alone program that you simply run directly off your USB drive, or from wherever you choose to copy it to your computer (i.e. the Desktop).

## p5

[p5](https://github.com/p5py/p5) -- not to be confused with p5.js -- is a Python package based on the core ideas of [Processing](https://processing.org/). There's also a [Python Mode](https://py.processing.org/) for Processing, which I have [written about]({{ site.baseurl }}/#processing-reverse) extensively. So, you may wonder: what's the difference between p5 and the Processing's Python Mode? Python Mode 'speaks' directly to Processing; it's as close as you can get to pure Processing without writing Java, because all of your Python instructions are translated into instructions for *Processing* to carry out.

p5 is sort of 'Python clone' of Processing, that doesn't actually use Processing to generate visual output. Rather, p5 is a recreation of Processing that's running on pure Python with no Processing/Java layer under the hood. This approach has it's advantages and disadvantages.

Unlike Processing's Python mode, p5 is compatible with Python 3 and Python libraries that use C extensions (e.g. Numpy). But, because p5 is a recreation of the Processing API, it's far more limited, hasn't been in development for very long, and cannot leverage the Processing library ecosystem.

## Combining Thonny + p5

To begin, download the portable version of Thonny from [https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases/](https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases/).

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/thonny-download.png" class="fullwidth" />
  <figcaption>At the time of writing, version 3.2.6 is the latest release</figcaption>
</figure>

Extract the zip file you've downloaded, then run the *thonny.exe* file to launch Thonny:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/thonny-extract.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

At the first prompt, you may change the *Language setting*, but stick with the default *Initial Settings*:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/thonny-splash.png" style="max-width:330px" />
</figure>

Test out Thonny with a simple `print('hello world')`. You use the run (green button) to run your script. If you hover over any button, a tool-tip will display the associated keyboard shortcut (*F5* for run). Thonny will ask you to save the file somewhere first. After that, it auto-saves each time you run your script.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/thonny-hello-world.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

Next, you must install the p5 packages. You want these packages to install this to your Thonny folder; this way, when you copy your Thonny folder to your USB drive, it will include the p5 packages. To do this, select *Tools > Open system shell...*

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/p5-package.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

Then, type `pip install p5` in the console window and hit enter. This will install p5 and its dependencies (glfw, triangle, vispy, numpy, Pillow, freetype-py).

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/p5-pip.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

Close the console window once this is done. If there are any errors, let me know in the comment section.

p5 uses VisPy, which requires GLFW. GLFW is an open-source library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan. Download the Windows pre-compiled binaries for GLFW. I had issues using the 64-bit binaries, so I'm directing you to use the 32-bit version:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/glfw-download.png" class="fullwidth" />
  <figcaption>The 32-bit binaries will run fine on 64-bit Windows</figcaption>
</figure>

Open the GLFW download, then navigate to the *lib-mingw* folder. There are three files within this (*glfw3.dll*, *libglfw3.a*, and *libglfwdll.a*). Copy/move these three files into your Thonny application folder, so that they reside in the same location as your *thonny.exe* file:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/glfw-copy-in.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

You have to tell VisPy where to find the *glfw3.dll* file. Navigate deeper into your Thonny folder -- into a folder named *Lib*, then into *site-packages*, then into *vispy*, then into *ext*. Open the *glfw.py* file in any text/code editor:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/glfw-locate.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

Locate the line that reads:  
`# Else, we failed and exit`  
Insert the following three lines above it:
~~~
import sys
_glfw_file = sys.executable.replace('\\', '\\\\')
_glfw_file = _glfw_file.replace('python.exe', 'glfw3.dll')
~~~

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/tpp/glfw-edit.png" class="fullwidth" />
  <figcaption>I'm using Atom, but you may use any code/text editor you prefer</figcaption>
</figure>

Save this edit. You can now run p5 sketches in Thonny!

Checkout the [p5 reference](https://p5.readthedocs.io) for more on how to use it.

## Sharing Your Thonny Remix

You can now copy your Thonny application folder to your USB drive. It may be quicker to zip/compress the folder first; this is also better for distributing it across the web or a LAN.

<sup markdown="1">If you wish to, you can delete all of the *.pyc* files and *\__pycache\__* directories before you zip/compress. If you don't know how to do this or what this means -- don't worry about it, it's not critical.</sup>
