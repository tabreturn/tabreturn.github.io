I must apologise: development of these lessons is on hold for now.

**The good news is that I'm writing a book. It's tentatively titled *Learn Python Visually: Creative Coding with Python Mode for Processing***. I'll be working with the good folks at [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/), purveyors of the finest in geek entertainment. You can expect a refined and designed version of what I've provided online, printed in full colour with new chapters and nice margins to scrawl in.

I will finish off the remaining lessons (listed below), but cannot say exactly when. You can visit from time to time to check for updates, or <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">subscribe via RSS</a>.

My thanks go to Åke Jonsson for his feedback on the lessons I've posted up to this point.

**In development**  
*Lesson 8: Functions* *([lesson code](https://github.com/tabreturn/processing.py-book/tree/master/chapter-09-functions_and_periodic_motion))*  
*Lesson 9: Object-Orientation* *([lesson code](https://github.com/tabreturn/processing.py-book/tree/master/chapter-10-object-oriented_programming_and_pvector/microscopic))*
