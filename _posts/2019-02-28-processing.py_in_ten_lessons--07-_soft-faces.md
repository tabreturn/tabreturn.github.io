In this tutorial, you will look at programming interactivity. Mouse, keyboard, and other interaction, opens up a whole new range of possibilities in Processing.  However, some useful Processing libraries provide an extended set of turnkey GUI features.

### Interfaces

It may hard to believe, but there was a time when computers had no video displays. We'll skip over the early punch cards and blinking lights chapter of computing history, though, and begin at the Command Line Interface (CLI). Early computers couldn't display much more than text and basic graphics, but this was enough to support a handy CLI, where, by typing a series of commands, one could instruct the computer to perform its various functions. However, the CLI is far from dead an buried. While it may no longer be the predominant means of interfacing with a computing devices, system administrators and programmers still rely on the CLI for their daily computing tasks. Mastering the command line unlocks powerful ways operate your computer and you are likely to be surprised by how much you can accomplish typing instructions. For example, to change directory, there is the `cd` command; to download files from the internet, there is the `wget` command. In the screenshot below, I change to my Desktop then download a copy of processing.py.

A Text-based User Interface (TUI) is a kind of blend between the CLI and modern graphic interface. TUIs render graphics in using text.

ANSII



If you have any experience with programming interfaces in other languages (perhaps some JavaScript, etc.), you'll quickly realise what I mean.
