[Reader View](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages) is a Firefox feature that strips away clutter like buttons, ads and background images, and changes the page's text size, contrast and layout for better readability. Reader View settings are easily customizable to fit your reading preferences.

It's how I (and many others?) prefer to read blogs and articles, so I reckon it must be the perfect format for this site! It's built using Jekyll, and includes [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/) (a Disqus alternative) and [Piwik](https://piwik.org/) (open-source analytics platform).

I intend to modify and improve the theme over time, but if you wish to do so yourself, just grab the source code from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tabreturn/tabreturn.github.io).
