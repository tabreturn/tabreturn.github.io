[Reader View](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages) is a Firefox feature that strips away clutter, such as buttons, ads, and background images; and adjusts text size, contrast and layout for better web-page readability. Reader View settings are easily customised to best suit an individual's desired reading preferences.

It's how I (and many others?) prefer to read blogs and articles, and an ideal model for this site! It's built as a Jekyll theme and integrates [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/) (a Disqus alternative) and [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (an open-source analytics platform).

I intend to modify and improve the theme over time, but if you wish to do so yourself, just grab the source code from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tabreturn/tabreturn.github.io).
