In this lesson you get to make things move. Our eyes begin to see con- tinuous motion at around 12 f.p.s The classic phi phenomenon experiment involves a viewer or audience watching a screen, upon which the experimenter projects two images in succession. The first image depicts a line on the left side of the frame. The second image depicts a line on the right ...

The content focuses primarily on animation, but to make things more fun, introduces transformations, time and date features, and a bit of trigonometry. As you will discover, blending animation with math produces some interesting results.





## Animation Functions

To get animating in Processing all you need is two functions.
By default, draw() executes around 60 f.p.s. (frames per second)
However, as complexity of an animation increases, the frame rate may also drop.

## Transformations

## Time and Date

## Animated Trigonometry
