I must apologise: development of these lessons is on hold for now.

**The good news is that I'm writing a book. It's tentatively titled *Processing.py: Learning Python the Visual Way***. I'll be working with the good folks at [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/), purveyors of the finest in geek entertainment. You can expect a refined and designed version of what I've provided online, printed in full colour with new chapters and nice margins to scrawl in.

I will finish off the remaining lessons (listed below), but cannot say exactly when. You can visit from time to time to check for updates, or <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">subscribe via RSS</a>.

My thanks go to Åke Jonsson for his feedback on the lessons I've posted up to this point.

**In development**  
*Lesson 8: Functions*  
*Lesson 9: Object-Orientation*  
*Lesson 10: Some Physics*  
*Bonus Lesson: 3D and Shaders*
