I've created two new resources to help Processing.py users -- **a website for browsing code examples** and a **cheat sheet for beginners**. If you're keen to learn more about Python Mode for Processing, I've written a [series of lessons]({{ site.baseurl }}/#processing-reverse). I've also got a book out, [Learn Python Visually](https://nostarch.com/Learn-Python-Visually), published by No Starch Press.

## 1. A Website for Browsing Code Examples


[PYDE.ORG](http://pyde.org/) hosts a collection of short, prototypical programs exploring the basics of programming with Processing.py.

So far, I've worked on porting the examples bundled with Processing's Python Mode (ordinarily accessible in the Processing IDE via the *File > Examples...* menu). Each entry displays a sketch that runs in the web browser along with its source code.

You can find the source code for the website on [GitHub](https://github.com/tabreturn/tabreturn.pyde). I built it using [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) for templating and [pyp5js](https://berinhard.github.io/pyp5js/) to transcribe processing.py files to p5.js. It uses a modified [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) lexer for syntax highlighting.

## 2. A Processing Python Mode / Processing.py Cheat Sheet for Beginners

I put together a Processing.py / Python Mode cheat sheet for beginners. If that sounds useful, you can [download the cheat sheet here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabreturn/processing.py-cheat-sheet/master/p.py_cc.pdf).

I figured a simple 2-pager works best (a single sheet of paper, printed on both sides). Once the user outgrows this cheat sheet, the official [Python Mode reference](https://py.processing.org/reference/) is probably more helpful than a cheat sheet with several more pages.

The source files are on [GitHub](https://github.com/tabreturn/processing.py-cheat-sheet). Add to- or edit as you please. I designed the cheat sheet using [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

## 3. Other Useful Resources

Alexandre Villares has compiled an excellent list of resources for teaching artists, designers, and architects to code with Python. Also, you should check out his impressive *sketch-a-day* repo:

* [https://github.com/villares/sketch-a-day](https://github.com/villares/sketch-a-day)

As an alternative to Processing 3D, you might try:

* [Blender scripting](https://tabreturn.github.io/#blender-reverse)
* [GlowScript](https://www.glowscript.org/)

For general Python usage, here's a Processing-less beginner Python cheat sheet by Eric Matthes:
