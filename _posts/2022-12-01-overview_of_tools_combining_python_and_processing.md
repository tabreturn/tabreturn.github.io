A while ago, I was reading over (and responding to) a post on the [Processing forums](https://discourse.processing.org). The thread discussed the future of Processing [Python Mode / Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/), but that's not exactly why I'm writing this blog post. What inspired me was one particular comment from *Setsuna* that read:

<em style="font-weight:bold; font-size:1.5em">py5, p5py, and now pyp5js... Is the community trying to get the newbies confused? Because it's working."</em>
<p><em>-- Setsuna, from the <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/t/what-is-the-future-of-processing-python-mode/35009/20">Processing forums</a></em></p>

Setsuna makes a valid point. People involved in developing Python implementations of Processing should take note. [Processing's Python Mode](https://py.processing.org/), [py5](https://py5.ixora.io/), [p5py](https://p5.readthedocs.io/), and [pyp5js](https://berinhard.github.io/pyp5js/) are all great tools that combining Python and Processing. Then, there's [Shoebot](http://shoebot.net/), [DrawBot](https://www.drawbot.com/), and similar projects that incorporate Processing ideas into a Python solution, albeit in ways that deviate more from the typical functions and workings of Processing. These tools offer unique abilities and advantages (and trade-offs), creating a richer Python creative coding ecosystem. However, it's easy to overwhelm a would-be creative coder, educator, or anybody else interested in exploring Python as a language for learning programming and creative computing applications.

## A Video Explanation

Enough introduction! I presented at SIGGRAPH 2022 on Python + Processing tools, which you can view at [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3532836.3536231](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3532836.3536231). The talk maps out the Python-Processing landscape, offering insight into the different options and providing direction for beginners, teachers, and more accomplished programmers keen to explore Python as a tool for creative coding projects.

The presentation begins with a light introduction to Processing, focusing on how Python Mode (also referred to as Processing.py) leverages Jython to interface with Processing's Java core. The explanation for how this works is the basis for describing the workings of several other Python + Processing tools.

I mention this in the video, but I'll state it here -- I consider Alexandre Villares' [*Processing + Python tools table*](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/Resources-for-teaching-programming/) the most well-maintained and concise summary of tools that combine Python and Processing. The webpage lists many other related tools (Shoebot, Blender's bpy, and more).

I must also note that, since I produced the video for SIGGRAPH, the [Processing Foundation has invited Tushar Gupta](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/announcing-google-summer-of-code-2022-projects-and-a-few-more-77043ab4d0b4) to work on integrating [Skia](https://skia.org/) as a 2D back-end renderer for p5py -- which will provide a significant performance boost and enhance several aspects of the project.

## Why Python?

I believe that a large part of [Processing](https://processing.org/)'s (and by extension, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) success is the appeal to creatives and first-time coders. But, in my opinion, Python is a better language for those people (than Java or JavaScript) -- it can do more than a single line than most other languages, and there's less having to tell beginners, "don't worry about that part, I'll explain it later." Even Ben Fry, Processing co-creator, thinks that ["Python is terrific"](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Processing-4#goodbye-java).

Brian Kernighan, the co-author of the book *C Programming Language*, provides some interesting opinions about first-time programming languages in a [Computerphile interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8LTEFNLZ6M). Of course, I'm (more than a little ðŸ˜‰) inclined to agree that Python is an excellent entry into programming, but it's also an in-demand language for professional work. This "low floor, high ceiling" quality benefits learning environments: some students enter with more transferable skills and experience; then, there are those who desire to explore beyond the course content in their project work. Kernighan's point on 'instant gratification' is poignant -- something that Processing does so well by generating graphic output as soon as you've opened your coding environment and typed a line or two of code.

## A Word on py5

I must disclose that I'm involved in py5 project, so I'm more-than-likely biased.

In addition, I'm working on a [py5 plug-in for the Thonny IDE](https://github.com/tabreturn/thonny-py5mode) that transforms [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) into a Processing PDE alternative for creative coding. Consider that beginners can't differentiate a library from a language from an IDE. "Processing" is just "Processing", IDE and all. The aim is to emulate the Python Mode plug-in experience in Processing's PDE.

Picking up an earlier point about low floors and high ceilings, Jim Schmitz, py5 creator [points out](https://github.com/py5coding/py5generator/discussions/21#discussioncomment-913097) --

*"Scratch is good for beginners, but you can't really go very far with it, so people might not want to invest a lot of time and effort into learning it. Python and py5 can go very far, so beginners can see a path from their first steps to something more ambitious, such as a program that combines py5 with Python ML tools."*

Did I mention py5 also supports Jupyter Notebook environments?

Unlike Processing's Python Mode / Processing.py, py5 supports Python 3 and works with other popular Python libraries and tools such as Jupyter, numpy, and Pillow. To close on another Ben Fry [comment on Python](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Processing-4#goodbye-java) (with reference to Processing.py's Jython implementation), he goes on to say, "but it'd be awesome to have available NumPy and all those other things that make Python wonderful." Hello py5!
