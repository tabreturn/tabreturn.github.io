**I have a new book out titled *Learn Python Visually – Creative Coding with Processing.py***. The book contains a refined and redesigned version of what I've provided online, printed in full colour with new chapters and nice margins to scrawl in. You can order a copy from the [No Starch website](https://nostarch.com/Learn-Python-Visually) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Visually-Tristan-Bunn-ebook/dp/B08JKNHDWN/).

The *functions* chapter is available as a free sample download here:  
[https://nostarch.com/download/samples/LearnPythonVisually_sampleChapter.pdf](https://nostarch.com/download/samples/LearnPythonVisually_sampleChapter.pdf)

I'll finish off the remaining lessons (listed below), but cannot say exactly when. You can visit from time to time to check for updates, or <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">subscribe via RSS</a>. My thanks go to Åke Jonsson for his feedback on the lessons I've posted up to this point.

**In development**  
*Lesson 9: Object-Orientation* *([lesson code](https://github.com/tabreturn/processing.py-book/tree/master/chapter-10-object-oriented_programming_and_pvector/microscopic))*  
*Lesson 10: Sound and Video*  
*Lesson 11: Some Physics*  
*Bonus Lesson: 3D and Shaders* *([another 3d tutorial](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/p3d/))*

As an alternative to Processing 3D, you might try [Blender scripting](https://tabreturn.github.io/#blender-reverse) or [GlowScript](https://www.glowscript.org/).
