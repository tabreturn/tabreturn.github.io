The programs you have written thus far execute line-by-line, beginning at the top of the code and ending at the bottom. You can visualise this sequential flow as a set of steps chained together in a linear arrangement. However, a programmer can redefine the order in which code is run, writing various calls and conditions to control the flow -- a concept that is referred to as *control flow* -- thereby allowing the program to skip, jump to, and repeat lines. Visualised, this looks like a series of branching and reconnecting paths.

Control flow allows for more 'intelligent' programs. For example: if you wished to fill the display window with circles, you could write and individually place each circle using an `ellipse` function; or, using control flow statements, instruct Processing to fill the display window row-by-row and stop once it's done.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to check conditions and provide appropriate responses. You can think of this as asking a *question*; receiving an *answer*; then perform an *action* in response the answer. For example:

*Question:* Is the ball red?

*Answer:* Yes.

*Action:* Place it in the bucket labelled "red balls".

To explore Python's various conditional statements, create a new sketch and save it as "conditional statements".

Add the following code:

{% highlight py %}
size(600,400)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)
{% endhighlight %}

### Boolean Datatype

You are now familiar with three types of datatypes: string, integer, and float. Before moving onto conditional statements, you need an introduction to a fourth type: boolean.

A boolean can represent one of two possible states: `True` or `False`. Note that when using this values, the first letter is always uppercase, and no quotation marks are used (as this would make the value a string). Add the following code:

{% highlight py %}
...

ball_is_red = True
ball_is_blue = False
print(ball_is_red)
print(ball_is_blue)
{% endhighlight %}
