In this tutorial,

In the next lesson, you will look at interactivity in Processing. As you will see, Processing is great for mouse, keyboard, and other interaction, but rather clumsy for building user interfaces. If you have any experience with programming interfaces in other languages (perhaps some JavaScript, etc.), you'll quickly realise what I mean. However, some useful Processing libraries provide an extended set of turnkey GUI features.
