The programs you have written thus far execute line-by-line, beginning at the top of the code and ending at the bottom. You can visualise this flow as a set of steps chained together in a linear arrangement. In this lesson, we explore how to lay divergent paths for the program to follow.

### Control Flow

A programmer can write various calls and conditions to reorder the linear sequence of execution -- a concept referred to as *control flow* -- thereby directing the program to skip, jump to, and repeat lines.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/intro-flowchart.svg" />
  <figcaption>Sequential (left) versus control-flowed execution (right).</figcaption>
</figure>

Control flow allows for more 'intelligent' programs. As an example: consider that you wish to fill the display window with circles.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/intro-circles.svg" />
  <figcaption>9-circle (left) and 81-circle (right) layouts.</figcaption>
</figure>

A 9-circle arrangement requires writing nine `ellipse` functions; this is manageable enough. However, writing eighty-one `ellipse` lines is tedious. Using control flow statements, one can instead instruct Processing to add as many circles as are required, ceasing once eighty-one have been placed. This allows for more dynamic code, i.e. you specify the size of circles, and the program calculates how many columns and rows are required. Additionally, this approach can better cater for random diameter values.

This lesson covers topics involving conditional statements and iteration. Implementing such logic may require you to think in new ways. If you find yourself struggling with something, do not stress, that's normal! With a little perseverance, youâ€™ll soon grasp whatever is that has you snagged.

You will also explore randomness -- one of the most powerful and exciting tools in the creative programmer's tool-set.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to check conditions and provide appropriate responses. You can think of this as asking a *question*; receiving an *answer*; then performing an *action* in response to the answer. For example:

*Question:* Is the ball red?

*Answer:* Yes.

*Action:* Place it in the bucket labelled "red balls".

To explore Python's various conditional statements, create a new sketch and save it as "conditional_statements". Add the following code:

{% highlight py %}
size(600,400)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)
{% endhighlight %}

### Boolean Datatype

At this point, you are familiar with three datatypes: string, integer, and float. Before moving onto conditional statements, you require an introduction to a fourth type: *boolean*.

A boolean can represent one of two possible states: `True` or `False`. Note that when writing these values, the first letter is always uppercase and no quotation marks are used (as this would make the value a string). Add the following code:

{% highlight py %}
...

ball_is_red = True
ball_is_blue = False
print(ball_is_red)
print(ball_is_blue)
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/conditional-statements-booleans.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

### Relational Operators

Relational operators determine the relationship between two operands. Consider this basic example:  
`3 > 2`  
In this case, `3` and `2` are the *operands*. The `>` sign is the *operator*. Three is greater than two, so this statement is true. To see how this works in Python, add the following code to your "conditional_statements" sketch:

{% highlight py %}
...

x = 2
print( x > 1 )        # displays: True
print( x < 1 )        # displays: False
{% endhighlight %}

Take note of how the relational operations return a boolean value; this will be important in the next section. Here is a list of Python's various relational operators:

`>    ` greater-than  
`<    ` less-than  
`>=   ` greater-than-or-equal-to  
`<=   ` less-than-or-equal-to  
`==   ` equal-to  
`!=   ` not-equal-to

The `==` and `!=` operators have the ability to operate on both numbers and strings:

{% highlight py %}
...
print( x == 2 )       # displays: True
name = 'Jo'
print( name == 'Jo' ) # displays: True
print( name != 'Em' ) # displays: True
{% endhighlight %}

Relational operators are particularly useful when combined with `if` and other conditional statements.

### If Statements

If statements are one of the essential means of introducing logic to your program. Add this basic example to your working sketch:

{% highlight py %}
...

mark = 60

if mark >= 50:
    print('PASS')
{% endhighlight %}

The code awards a PASS grade for any mark greater-than-or-equal-to fifty. In the above case the `mark >= 50` returns `True`; so the `print('PASS')` line is executed. It is vital that you indent the `print` line, for which you may use a tab or space characters. It does not matter how many spaces -- although, four or two is most common -- but you must be consistent throughout your code. Everything indented beneath the `if` line is executed upon the condition returning `True`. For example, the following code will print "PASS" and "Well done!" for any mark greater-than-or-equal-to fifty:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 60

if mark >= 50:
    print('PASS')
    print('Well done!')
{% endhighlight %}

But, the following code will print "Well done!" regardless of whether or not the mark exceeds fifty:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 20

if mark >= 50:
    print('PASS')
print('Well done!')
{% endhighlight %}

To nest an `if` statement within another `if` statement, increase the indentation accordingly:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 60
language = 'ES'

if mark >= 50:
    print('PASS')

    if language == 'EN':
        print('Well done!')

    if language == 'ES':
        print('Bien Hecho!')
{% endhighlight %}

The above displays "Bien Hecho!".

If you are evaluating a boolean value you may leave out the `==` operator. For example:

{% highlight py %}
ball_is_green = True

if ball_is_green == True:
    print('The ball is green')

# is the same as:

if ball_is_green:
    print('The ball is green')
{% endhighlight %}

The `ball_is_green` variable is equal to `True`, so typing `ball_is_green == True` is equivalent to `True == True`. Either way, the answer is `True`! Still, if you find it helps to be more explicit, you can use the first version.

#### Else-If Statements

Currently, the grading program can only award a PASS. Ideally, it should assign letter grades (A/B/C/...). This requires additional if statements. Adapt your code:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 60

if mark >= 50:
    print('C')

if mark >= 65:
    print('B')
{% endhighlight %}

As you would expect, the console displays a "C". But there is an issue -- a mark of `70` results in a "C" and "B":

{% highlight py %}
mark = 70

if mark >= 50:
    print('C')

if mark >= 65:
    print('B')
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/conditional-statements-if-cb.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

The problem here is that both `if` statements operate independently of one another. If the grade is awarded a "B" then there is no need to check the C condition. An `elif` (else-if) statement is required, along with some reordering of your code:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 70

if mark >= 65:
    print('B')

elif mark >= 50:
    print('C')
{% endhighlight %}

This correctly displays a "B" in the Console. Because the `if` line returns `True`, the `elif` is skipped. This is why the correct ordering of `if`/`elif` statements is vital; should the C condition to come first, every mark greater-than-or-equal-to 50 is awarded a C-grade, as the B condition is skipped.

Chain another `elif` statement to the code, adjusting the mark to test three different cases:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 77

if mark >= 80:
    print('A')
elif mark >= 65:
    print('B')
elif mark >= 50:
    print('C')
{% endhighlight %}

To visually group the connected `if`/`elif` statements, the empty line between each has been removed; this is a matter of style, but you are welcome to add as many blank lines as you see fit. You may add as many additional `elif` statements as you need.

A mark below `50` passes through all of the `if`/`elif` statements without invoking any action. To handle FAIL cases, one can employ `else` statement.

#### Else Statements

Else statements handle any condition that does not match that specified in the `if` statement (or `if`/`elif` grouping). Add an `else` statement to your code:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 49

if mark >= 80:
    print('A')
elif mark >= 65:
    print('B')
elif mark >= 50:
    print('C')
else:
    print('FAIL')
{% endhighlight %}

The `else` statement need not necassarily follow an `elif`. For example:

{% highlight py %}
if mark >= 50:
    print('PASS')
else:
    print('FAIL')
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, this all depends on the logic you intend to implement.

#### Logical Operators

Thus far, each of the `if`/`elif` statements have been based on the outcome of a single relational operation; for instance:  
*is the mark greater-than-or-equal-to fifty?*

However, there are many occasions where multiple relational operations must be evaluated within a single condition; for example:  
*is the mark greater-than-or-equal-to forty-five AND less-than fifty?*

For these purposes, Python provides three logical operators:

`and   ` returns `True` if both operands are true  
`or    ` returns `True` if at least one operand is true  
`not   ` reverses the boolean (`True` becomes `False` and vice-versa)

Add an `and` condition to handle marks in the RESUBMIT range:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 49

if mark >= 80:
    print('A')
elif mark >= 65:
    print('B')
elif mark >= 50:
    print('C')
elif mark >= 45 and mark < 50:
    print('RESUBMIT')
else:
    print('FAIL')
{% endhighlight %}

Now add an `or` condition to catch marks outside of the valid range:

{% highlight py %}
mark = 105

if mark < 0 or mark > 100:
    print('INVALID MARK')
elif mark >= 80:
    print('A')
elif mark >= 65:
    print('B')
elif mark >= 50:
    print('C')
elif mark >= 45 and mark < 50:
    print('RESUBMIT')
else:
    print('FAIL')
{% endhighlight %}

The `not` operator has its uses but is awkward to apply in the working example. Instead, here is a one-line example of it in action:

`print( not(False) )   # displays: True`

## Four-Square Task

In this challenge, you will apply conditional statements to a visual task. Create a new sketch and save it as "four_square". Add the following code:

{% highlight py %}
size(600,600)
noFill()
noStroke()

fill('#FF0000') # red quadrant
rect(width/2,0, width/2,height/2)

fill('#004477') # blue quadrant
rect(0,0, width/2,height/2)

fill('#6633FF') # violet quadrant
rect(0,height/2, width/2,height/2)

fill('#FF9900') # orange quadrant
rect(width/2,height/2, width/2,height/2)
{% endhighlight %}

The above code divides the display window into four quadrants:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/four-square-quadrants.png" />
</figure>

Next, place a character at some location determined by an x- and y-coordinate variable:

{% highlight py %}
...
rect(width/2,height/2, width/2,height/2)

x = 400
y = 100
txt = '?'

fill('#FFFFFF')
textSize(40)
textAlign(CENTER, CENTER)
text(txt, x,y)
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/four-square-qmark.png" />
</figure>

Your challenge is to write conditional statements to replace the `?` character with an `R`, `B`, `P`, or `O` to match the colour beneath it. This way, one can adjust just the `x` and `y` values and the character changes accordingly:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/four-square-four-up.png" />
  <figcaption>Listed counter-clockwise from the top-right, the (x,y) coordinates of each letter are:
  R = (400,100);
  B = (38,121);
  P = (289,485);
  O = (338,485).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

To start you off, here is the code for the red (`R`) condition:

{% highlight py %}
...

x = 400
y = 100
txt = '?'

if x >= width/2:
    txt = 'R'

fill('#FFFFFF')
...
{% endhighlight %}

However, if you change the `y` value to `400`, an "R" is displayed over the orange quadrant. Begin by correcting this, then address the other quadrants.

## Iteration

Consider that you wish to tile a floor. Starting in one corner, you place a single tile. Next, you place another tile alongside that, repeating the process until you have reached the opposite wall; after which point you move down a row and continue. In this scenario, the placing of an individual tile is referred to as an *iteration*. In many iterative processes, the result of a previous iteration defines the starting point of another -- in this case, the position of each tile is advanced by the one laid before it.

Tasks like tiling can be tedious work, though. Humans are exemplary in reasoning and creative thought, and if not sufficiently stimulated, lose interest in performing such repetitive tasks. Computers, however, excel in performing monotonous duties rapidly and accurately -- especially where numbers are involved. Interestingly enough, the term "computer" originally referred to a person who performs mathematical calculations. Much of the work carried-out by 'human computers' involved calculating *mathematical tables*. These tables of numbers would be compiled into printed volumes that were used to simplify and speed-up other computations. As an example, *logarithm tables* were used extensively in sciences, engineering, and navigation.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/wikimedia-backup/lossless-page1-789px-APN2002_Table_1%2C_1000-1500.agr.tiff.png" />

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Rather than perform tedious multiplication and division operations by hand, logarithm tables provide lists of pre-computed answers -- like a more advanced version of the multiplication tables children are required to memorise in school. The forerunner of the modern computer, the *Difference Engine*, was built in the 1820s by Charles Babbage to automate the work of human computers. By devising a machine comprised of cogs and other moving parts, Babbage sought to automate the task of producing mathematical tables, while also providing more accurate results. Due to funding difficulties, a full-scale version of the machine was never completed -- but its mechanical inner-workings paved the way for more complex electronic computers.

To begin exploring iteration in Processing, create a new sketch and save it as "concentric_circles". Add the following code:

{% highlight py %}
size(500,500)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)

ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30,30)
ellipse(width/2,height/2, 60,60)
ellipse(width/2,height/2, 90,90)
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-manual.png" />
</figure>

I'm sure you can see where this is heading -- filling the display window requires writing many more `ellipse` lines. Instead of adding these manually, you will make use of Pythonâ€™s `while` loop to insert them iteratively.

### While Loops

The `while` loop statement looks and behaves much like the `if`. However, the key difference is that the `while` continues to execute the lines indented beneath it *until* the condition is no longer true.

Comment out your ellipse lines and add a basic `while` structure:

{% highlight py %}
'''
ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30,30)
ellipse(width/2,height/2, 60,60)
ellipse(width/2,height/2, 90,90)
'''

i = 0

while i < 24:
    print(i)
{% endhighlight %}

Running the sketch prints endless lines of single `0` digits to the Console.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-crash.png" class="fullwidth" />
  <figcaption>Notice the length of the Console scroll-track, and how the display window fails to render the background colour.</figcaption>
</figure>

This code has crashed your program by sending it into an infinitive loop. To explain, `i` is equal to zero, and therefore less-than to `24`. But, unlike an `if` statement, the `while` repeatedly executes the `print` line until the value of `i` reaches twenty-four -- which is never.

To increment `i` by one each time the line is printed, add one to it with each iteration of the loop:

{% highlight py %}
i = 0

while i < 24:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-increment.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

You may name this `i` variable whatever you wish, but it is a popular convention to represent the *iterator* value using an `i`.

The final line (`i = i + 1`) states that `i` is equal to itself plus one. Once `i` reaches twenty-four, the program can continue with any other code that follows beneath the loop structure. To draw twenty-four circles, place an `ellipse` function within the loop:

{% highlight py %}
i = 0

while i < 24:
    print(i)
    ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30,30)
    i = i + 1
{% endhighlight %}

Run the code. It appears that you have drawn a single circle:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-stacked-circles.png" />
</figure>

However, what you are actually is seeing twenty-four circles of the same size drawn in the same location. Adapt the `ellipse`, using the `i` value as a multiplier for the width and height (third and fourth) arguments:

{% highlight py %}
i = 0

while i < 24:
    print(i)
    ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30*i,30*i)
    i = i + 1
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-concentric-circles.png" />
</figure>

It should be pointed out that the width/height arguments (`30*i`) of the first iteration are multiplied by `0`, so the first circle is placed in the very centre of the display window but is effectively too small to be visible. The other twenty-three are sufficient to fill the 500 by 500-pixel area -- but by changing the condition, you can draw as many (or as few circles) as you like.

### Augmented Assignment Operators

You are already familiar with the `=` operator, but not its arithmetic variants. In the "concentric_circles" example, `i` was incremented using this line of code:  
`i = i + 1`  
To simplify this statement, one can instead write:  
`i += 1`  

Other similar operators include:  
`i -= 1 ` is equivalent to&nbsp; `i = i - 1`  
`i *= 1 ` is equivalent to&nbsp; `i = i * 1`  
`i /= 1 ` is equivalent to&nbsp; `i = i / 1`

For anybody familiar with other programming languages, Python does not make use of `--` and `++` in/de-crement operators.

### Rows of Circles Task

Time for another challenge!

Using a while loop, you will recreate this arrangement:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/rows-of-circles.png" />
</figure>

To begin, create a new sketch and save it as "rows_of_circles". Add the following code to get started:

{% highlight py %}
size(500,500)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)
ellipse(100,100, 80,80)
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/rows-of-circles-start.png" />
</figure>

The following sequence of steps outlines the most straightforward approach to begin tackling this task:

1. create a `while` structure that loops twelve times (consider using a `print()` to monitor your iterator);
2. using the loop, place the circles in one long row, extending past the right edge of the display window;
3. once the above is working, use an `if` statement within the loop to detect when the second row must begin.

It's up to you to figure out the rest. Oh -- and remember that [modulo operator (%)]({% post_url 2018-06-12-processing.py_in_ten_lessons--01-_hello_world %}#modulo-operator)? It may prove handy here.

### For Loops

When programming a loop structure, you are not limited to `while` statements. The `for` loop operates similarly; depending on the scenario, you may elect to use one over the other. Perhaps the easiest way to explain a `for` loop is to convert something you have already written.

Create a new sketch and save it as "for_loop". Add the following the code from your "concentric_circles" sketch:

{% highlight py %}
size(500,500)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)

i = 0

while i < 24:
    print(i)
    ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30*i,30*i)
    i += 1
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how the `i` variable is created to serve as an iterator. With each iteration of the loop, it is vital that you increment `i` to avoid entering an endless loop. The `for` loop does away with the need for iterator variables. Adapt your code to make use of a `for`:

{% highlight py %}
size(500,500)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)

for i in range(24):
    print(i)
    ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30*i,30*i)
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how the `i = 0` line has been removed, along with the line to increment it (`i += 1`). Despite these changes, the result remains the same:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-for-loop-adaption.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

The `range()` function generates a list of values that the `for` then iterates over. With each iteration, the acting `range` value is assigned to the variable `i` -- although you may name this whatever you wish. For twenty-four iterations, the `range` function requires an argument of `24`; but the end value of twenty-four is never part of the generated list because the first iteration begins with `0`.

The range function can handle between one and three parameters. Provide two arguments for a start and end value:

{% highlight py %}
for i in range(8,12):
    print(i)
    ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30*i,30*i)
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-for-loop-2-args.png" />
</figure>

Provide three arguments for a start, end, and step-size:

{% highlight py %}
for i in range(0,24,2):
    print(i)
    ellipse(width/2,height/2, 30*i,30*i)
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-for-loop-3-args.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

Any iterable object may be used in combination with a `for`, meaning the `range()` function is not always necessary. This concept is explored in the upcoming lessons dealing with lists and dictionaries (or "arrays" if you are familiar with other programming language terminology).

### For Loops Task

In this challenge you will recreate these three patterns using `for` loops:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-for-loops-task.png" />
  <figcaption>The <span style="color:#0099FF">pale blue</span> lines and coordinates detail the line drawn on the first iteration of each loop.</figcaption>
</figure>

You will be referencing this image repeatedly during the task, so it may be useful to <a href="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/iteration-for-loops-task.png" download>save a copy</a> and open a preview of it alongside your Processing editor.

To begin, create a new sketch and save it as "for_loops_task". Add the following setup code:

{% highlight py %}
size(600,600)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)
{% endhighlight %}

Here are a few clues to help you approach each pattern:

* *Top-left pattern:* you should manage this without any hints; it has twelve lines if you must know.
* *Top-right pattern:* the line spacing increases by a multiple of `1.5` with each iteration.
* *Bottom-centre pattern*: consider using a modulo operator to establish `if` the iterator is odd or even.

After successfully completing this, you should have a decent grasp of loops.

## Randomness

The best a computer can do is simulate randomness. Think about this for a moment: if you request a random number from a computer, it will need to run some non-random set of instructions to pull a value. That said, computers can manage a pretty good job of this, relying on algorithms that generate *pseudorandom* numbers whose sequential appearance is statistically similar enough to a truly random sequence. This is okay for shuffling through your music collection, but best avoided for gambling and security applications.

For 'true' random numbers, computers can rely on things like key-stroke timings. For instance, you may have pressed your last key 0.654 milliseconds past the tick of the previous second. In the quest for true randomness, researchers have relied on everything from dice to roulette wheels, and between the mid-1920s and 50s one could even purchase special books full of random numbers. If you are really serious about plucking random numbers from the universe, there are hardware devices that rely on various quantum phenomena, like [radioactive decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxP30euw3-0). However, for most applications, pseudorandomness will suffice.

So, what do random sequences look like? First, consider *Perlin noise*. In 1983, Ken Perlin developed an algorithm for synthesising organic textures and forms -- like terrains, fire, smoke, and clouds. The graphs below plot random points (vertical axis) over fixed intervals of time (horizontal axis). The upper line represents a sequence of 'purely' random points, whereas the lower line charts values generated with Perlin noise. From this, you can visually appreciate why the 'smoother' Perlin noise is better suited for generating something like a mountain range.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-random-v-noise.png" class="fullwidth" />
  <figcaption>Random (top) verse Perlin noise (bottom) sequences.</figcaption>
</figure>

Processing has functions for Perlin noise, but this lesson will focus on the `random()` and `randomSeed()` functions.

### Random Functions

Create a new sketch and save it as "random_functions". Add the following setup code:

{% highlight py %}
size(600,600)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)
{% endhighlight %}

The `random()` function takes one or two arguments. One argument defines an upper limit:

{% highlight py %}
...

x = random(5)
print(x)

The above code will display a random floating point value between `0` and `5`. Two arguments represent an upper- and lower-limit respectively:

{% highlight py %}
x = random(5)
print(x)
x = random(5,10)
print(x)
{% endhighlight %}

The above displays a random floating point value between `5` and `10`. If it is a random integer you seek, wrap this the `x` in an `int()` function. This converts the floating point to an integer by removing the decimal point and everything that follows it (effectively, rounding-down):

{% highlight py %}
x = random(5)
print(x)
x = random(5,10)
print(x)
print( int(x) )
{% endhighlight %}

  <figcaption>Given that the values are random, the Console output will appear different each time you run the sketch.</figcaption>
</figure>

The next step is to generate one hundred random values. Rather than print a long list in the Console area, plot them as a series of points along the same y-axis:

{% highlight py %}
...

for i in range(100):
    point( random(width), height/2 )
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-points-1d.png" />
  <figcaption>The spread of points will vary each time the sketch is run.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now edit the loop. Change the range to `1000` and plot the `point` using both a random x- and y-coordinate:

{% highlight py %}
for i in range(1000):
    point( random(width), random(height) )
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-points-2d.png" />
  <figcaption>Four runs of the same code. Notice (perhaps by comparing a given corner) how each is unique.</figcaption>
</figure>

Each time the code is run, it produces a slightly different pattern. Recall, though, that these are pseudorandom sequences. What the `random()` function does is pick an initial random number (based on something such as keystroke timing), then generates an entire sequence based upon this. The initial value is referred to as the *seed*. Using Processing's `randomSeed()` function, one can set the seed parameter manually, thereby ensuring that the same sequence of pseudorandom numbers is generated each time the sketch is run. Add a `randomSeed()` to your working sketch -- the argument may be any integer, but use `213` to verify that your output matches that depicted below.

{% highlight py %}
randomSeed(213)
size(600,600)
...
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-points-seed.png" />
  <figcaption><code>randomSeed(213)</code></figcaption>
</figure>

Unlike the earlier versions in which no random seed had been defined, every run of the code produces the same pattern, on any computer that executes it. This is useful in many applications. As a concrete example, suppose you developed a platform game in which the positions of obstacles are randomly generated. This feature saves you a lot of time, as you no longer have to design each level manually. However, you find that certain sequences of random numbers produce more engaging levels than others. If you are aware of these key seed values, you can reproduce each good level with an integer.

### Truchet Tiles

SÃ©bastien Truchet (1657--1729), a French Dominican priest, was active in the fields of mathematics, hydraulics, graphics and typography. Among his many contributions, he developed a scheme for creating interesting patterns using tiles -- which have since become known as *Truchet tiles*. The original Truchet tile is square and divided by a diagonal line between opposing corners. This tile can be rotated in multiples of ninety degrees to produce four variants.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-truchet-contrast-set.png" />
  <figcaption>The original Truchet tile, presented in its four possible orientations.</figcaption>
</figure>

These tiles are arranged on a square grid -- either randomly, or according to some pattern -- to create aesthetically-pleasing patterns.

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-truchet-variants.png" />
  <figcaption>Systematic versus random (bottom-right) Truchet tile arrangements.</figcaption>
</figure>

There are other Truchet tile forms, such as the quarter-circle tile:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-truchet-quarter-circle-set.png" />
  <figcaption>Truchet quarter-circle tile presented in its two possible orientations.</figcaption>
</figure>

Using the looping and randomness techniques from the lesson, you will now experiment with this. Create a new sketch and save it as "truchet_tiles". Add the following setup code, which includes a single tile:

{% highlight py %}
size(600,600)
background('#004477')
noFill()
stroke('#FFFFFF')
strokeWeight(3)

arc(0,0, 50,50, 0,PI/2)
arc(50,50, 50,50, PI,PI+PI/2)
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-truchet-quarter-circle-single.png" />
</figure>

Now comment-out the `arc` lines and tile the entire display window using a `for` loop:

{% highlight py %}
#arc(0,0, 50,50, 0,PI/2)
#arc(50,50, 50,50, PI,PI+PI/2)

col = 0
row = 0

for i in range(1,145):
    arc(col,row, 50,50, 0,PI/2)
    arc(col+50,row+50, 50,50, PI,PI+PI/2)
    col += 50

    if i%12 == 0:
        row += 50
        col = 0
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-truchet-quarter-circle-single-loop.png" />
</figure>

The next step is to randomise each tile's orientation. Because there are only two options, the loop must effectively 'flip a coin' with each iteration. A `random(2)` will return floating point values ranging from `0.0` up to `2.0`. Converting the result to an integer, therefore, produces a `0` *or* `1`.

{% highlight py %}
for i in range(1,145):
    print( int(random(2)) )

    arc(col,row, 50,50, 0,PI/2)
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

After verifying that the above code prints lines of `1` or `0` to the Console, adapt it to display `True`/`False` results.

{% highlight py %}
for i in range(1,145):
    print( int(random(2)) == 1 )

    arc(col,row, 50,50, 0,PI/2)
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-truchet-quarter-circle-flip-a-coin.png" class="fullwidth" />
</figure>

Because this operation returns a boolean value, it can be used as an `if` statement condition. Add an `if`-`else` structure:

{% highlight py %}
for i in range(1,145):
    #print( int(random(2)) == 1 )

    if int(random(2)) == 1:
        arc(col,row, 50,50, 0,PI/2)
        arc(col+50,row+50, 50,50, PI,PI+PI/2)
    else:
        arc(col+50,row, 50,50, PI/2,PI)
        arc(col,row+50, 50,50, PI+PI/2,2*PI)

    col += 50

    if i%12 == 0:
        row += 50
        col = 0
{% endhighlight %}

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/random-truchet-quarter-circle-done.png" />
  <figcaption>Randomised quarter-circle sketch.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you have ever played the strategy game [Trax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trax_(game)), this pattern will look familiar. Another tile-based strategy game [Tantrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantrix) uses a hexagonal adaption of a Truchet tile.

Tiles are an exciting area to explore using Processing, and we'll look at other types in the lessons to come.

## Progressively-Jittery Quads Task

Here is the final challenge before moving onto lesson 04.

This one appears in Ira Greenberg's *Processing: Creative Coding and Generative Art in Processing 2* (page 80). It's a great book that presents a fun and creative approach to learning programming. It is based on Processing's Java mode (rather than Python) and well worth a read.

</figure>

You will be referencing this image during the task, so it may be useful to <a href="{{ site.url }}/img/pitl03/progressively-jittery-quads.png" download>save a copy</a> and open a preview of it alongside your Processing editor.

Create a new sketch and save is "progressively_jittery_quads". The display window is 600 pixels wide by 600 pixels high. Go ahead and complete the task.

## Lesson 04

That's it for lesson 03. Kudos for getting through it -- control flow is a tricky matter to get your head around at first! I trust that introducing random values has inspired some exciting project ideas.

The next lesson deals with animation. There is a bit you need to know about matrices and trigonometry, though. If you find yourself experiencing disturbing flashbacks of high school math class â€“ take a deep breath and relax. Lesson 04 will be a practical and visual reintroduction to these concepts, with Processing crunching all of the numbers for you.

If statements and loops will reappear throughout this course, which will give you plenty of opportunities to master them. If you have some extra time, read up on the [continue](http://py.processing.org/reference/continue.html) and [break](http://py.processing.org/reference/break.html) statements. These are two useful loop techniques that allow one to skip over iterations, or to â€˜break-outâ€™ of loop structures.
