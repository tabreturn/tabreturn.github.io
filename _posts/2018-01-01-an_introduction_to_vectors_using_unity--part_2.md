Firstly: this post looks at vectors, *as in physics*, otherwise referred to as *Euclidean vectors* (not scalable graphics). Unity includes built-in features for dealing with 2- and 3-dimensional vectors, but the purpose of this tutorial is to understand vector concepts and math from the bottom up. You will write your own 2D vector code from scratch, and once this is complete, take a look at what Unity offers.

## Introduction

To keep things as simple as possible, this tutorial makes use of *UnityScript*. Anyone familiar with the basics of Unity, and some programming language (be it JavaScript, Python, C#, or something similar) should grasp things just fine. To get started, all you'll need is [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), and:
